When using a table, make sure to have the correct items listed as header items


<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Name</th>
		<th>Email</th>
		<th>Job-role</th>
	</tr>
</table>



In order to correctly organize the information on the screen, especially for 
screen readers and crawlers, label the first column/name column with a header tag <th>


Once the first column or row is assigned, the browser needs to know exactly what 
that element is. 

	
In order to do that, use the "scope" attribute 

<table>
	<tr>
		<th scope="col">Name</th>
		<th scope="col">Email</th>
		<th scope="col">Job-role</th>
	</tr>
</table>
