There is a difference between the <th> tag, which is a child tag, and 
a <thead> tag, which is actually a mother tag. 

<th> - child tag, nested
<thead> - mother tag 
<tbody> - mother tag


By grouping text in either a thead, or tbody tag, we can organize everything
very well 



<table>
	<thead>
	</thead>

	<tbody>
	</tobody>
</table>


After all is said and done, a table footer can be applied, BUT!! it must be placed directly after <thead> and directly before <tfoot>


<table>
	<thead>
	</thead>

	<tfoot>
		<tr>
			<td>This section will appear under the table as a note.</td> 		
		</tr>
	</tfoot>

	<tbody> 
	</tbody>


Q: What does colspan do?

	A: colspan allows you to designate how much space the table footer will take
	   up underneath the table. A setting of one will only allow the text 
	   to only take up the space under one row. A colspan of 3 will make the 
	   text take up all of the space possible underneath the entire table.
