When setting up all of the buttons, the form landing space will be blank. 
By using the label element, we can write words in the boxes themselves. 



	<form action="index.html" method="post">
	
		<h1>Sign Up</h1>

		<label for="name">Name:</label>
		<input type="text" id="name" name="user_name">


		BASED OFF OF WHAT I CAN TELL, THE LABEL ASSIGNED WILL MODIFY THE 
		ID TAG

		IN ADDITION, MAKE SURE TO ORDER THE TEXT CORRECTLY AND IT WILL 
		CASCADE BASED OFF OF ITS POSITION.
