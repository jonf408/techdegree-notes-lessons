If you want to group information or data at any point within a table, use the fieldset attribute to do so. 

<fieldset>
	<name>
	<email>
	<password>
</fieldset>


BY GROUPING THE DATA TOGETHER IN A GROUP SET, WE CAN EXPORT THAT CHUNK OF DATA 
AS A GROUP BY USING THE LEGEND ATTRIBUTE 



<fieldset>

	<legend><span class="number">2</span> Your profile</legend>	

	<label>
	<input>

	<label>
	<input>

	<label>
	<input>

</fieldset>


Q: Why would we use the legend attribute?
	A: In order to organize infomation better. 
	B: Allows more of a clear path for them to follow.
